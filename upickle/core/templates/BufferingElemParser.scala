/**
  * Models a growable [[buffer]] of Elems, which are Chars or Bytes. We maintain
  * an Array[Elem] as a buffer, and read Elems into it using [[readDataIntoBuffer]]
  * and drop old Elems using [[dropBufferUntil]].
  *
  * In general, [[BufferingElemParser]] allows us to keep the fast path fast:
  *
  * - Reading elem-by-elem from the buffer is a bounds check and direct Array
  *   access, without any indirection or polymorphism.
  * - We load Elems in batches into the buffer, which allows us to take advantage
  *   of batching APIs like `InputStream.read`
  * - We amortize the overhead of the indirect/polymorphic [[readDataIntoBuffer]]
  *   call over the size of each batch
  *
  * Note that [[dropBufferUntil]] only advances a [[dropped]] index and does not
  * actually zero out the dropped Elems; instead, we wait until we need to call
  * [[growBuffer]], and use that as a chance to copy the remaining un-dropped Elems
  * to either the start of the current [[buffer]] or the start of a newly-allocated
  * bigger [[buffer]] (if necessary)
